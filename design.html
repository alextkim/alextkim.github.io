	<center><h1> Traits That Help Me as a Designer </h1></center>
	
	</br>
	
	<img src="images/curiosity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>1.Curiosity</h3>
	<p>
	A good designer should question everything. A big part of being a designer is making thoughtful 
	decisions for your product and or company. This means every step should be evaluated and made certain
	that it is the company’s best interest.
	</p>
	<img src="images/humulity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>2.Humility</h3>
	<p>
	Although it can be good for a designer to have passion I believe it is very important for a designer to
	separate themselves from their work. Whether it be a good product or bad, it is hard to receive 
	constructive criticism if you are too attached to your work. Also with humility follows the need/want 
	to improve and continually iterate and improve your work.
	</p>
	<img src="images/communication.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>3.Communication</h3>
	<p>
	Designers have a myriad of options at their disposal that allow them to communicate their ideas with their
	developer teammates for a good reason. A designer needs to make sure that their teammates are on board with 
	their plan because without a team a designer is useless. Good communication is why I believe it’s important 
	for designers to be at least familiar with the production side of product development. This also means a 
	good designer needs to be a great listener.
	</p>
	<img src="images/empathy.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>4.Empathy</h3>
	<p>
	This one may seem interesting but it’s probably one of the most important ones on this list. Being a good
	designer is much like being a great host; a designer needs to think about and care for their customers.
	This means getting in their shoes and seeing what they need before they even know they need it. This why
	UX research and observation are a designers best friend.
	</p>
	<img src="images/integrity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>5.Integrity</h3>
	<p>
	As a designer you will most likely be giving somebody an order at some point in your career. With that in mind,
	it’s within your best interest to be man/woman of your word in all aspects in life (not just the work place)
	because how can you expect somebody to take orders from you when you don’t take your own words seriously.

	<center><h1>Frequently Asked Questions<h1></center>

	<h1 style="text-align:left;float:left;">Q.</h1><h3> "What is design?"</h3>
	<p>	    Design is not
	limited to the three icons above (ideation, coding, and art) but in every choice we make.
	At its very core design is simply thoughtful decision making.
	</p>
	
	<h1 style="text-align:left;float:left;">Q.</h1><h3> "What is the difference between UX and UI?"</h3>
	<p> Ux, which stands for User eXperience, is about designing an overall product that’s meets
	the core values of your team. UI, which stands for User Interface, is about creating the visual
	layout of the said product. Thus, UI is a branch of UX that plays an important role in the 
	aesthetics and feel of product. 
	</p>
	
	<h1 style="text-align:left;float:left;">Q.</h1><h3> "What careers can you pursue as a designer?"</h3>
	<p>Design is everywhere around us. Whether its choosing which top goes well with your 
	pants, deciding between phone brands, or contemplating over which components of an API you can use,
	design is everywhere and has been around forever. Therefore, I believe design can applied
	to any company that has a product because decisions will always need to be made.
	</p>
	
	<h1 style="text-align:left;float:left;">Q.</h1><h3>"How can a designer help me?"</h3>
	<p>Anyone can be a designer. Like I mentioned above, people design all the time. What
	separates good design from bad design however is designers are trained (through practice) to 
	take a step back before implementing and research what would be in the team’s best interest;
	this can get tricky because decisions are expensive. This is not something that is particularly 
	popular in today’s fast paced world where slogans like Nike’s “just do it” seem to be encultured 
	in today’s society.
