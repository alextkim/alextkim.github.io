	<h3>About this Project</h3>
	
	
	
		
		
		<p>
		

<b> Campus can be scary at night when waling alone. </b> Talking to fellow students on campus, we found out that a surprising amount of students feel the need to use some sort of personal protection
 when walking around at night (eg. flash lights or pepper spray). This is ridiculous because our college campus should feel like a home away from
 home and the idea that we “need” self protection to simply stroll across campus symbolizes that we have an ever present fear in the back of our 
 mind. <b> We feel that safety should not be the sole responsibility of the individual but a community effort</b>.

	<center><p><small>some of the ideas we came up as a group</small></p></center>
	<p>
	Making storyboards of various ideas helped us envision what acting out our ideas would be like. 
	For instance, as we kept delving into the reactions to the video, we realized that the reactions
	we were hypothesizing were not the reactions we necessarily wanted, and further considering the
	time and effort that would have to be put into making the video, the idea quickly depreciated as a
	potential design intervention. The other ideas were slightly easier to implement, such as a
	dissemination of pepper spray containers with a little blurb about our values, a booth to get 
	items for personal safety, an email that would be seemingly sent out by UCSD, and a way to 
	provide on-campus rides for people alone at night.

	<h3> Prototypes </h3>
	
	
	
	<center><img src="images/critMap.png"  id = "pfp3"></center>
	<center><p><small>For our first prototype we wanted to focus on the fact that campus is empty</small></p></center>

	<p>
	<b>ProtoType #1 Night-life Map</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i>Design Goal</i>: Wanted students to realize a night community will make people feel safer at night, by providing a visual.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Various areas of campus (colleges, central parts of campus, etc.) would hold particular night-time events at time intervals throughout 
	the year. Increased attention to these events and encouragement of being safe in groups at night would gradually encourage a night-life 
	on campus. Students would also be encouraged to explore the campus by having to go to different areas of interest, which can cultivate 
	familiarity with the campus. This critical design works to make safety a part of campus culture, where students are safe without having 
	to physically own something or train themselves to think a particular way, because the campus environment enforces protection via a collective ideology.

	<p>
	<b>ProtoType #2 1st Person POV: Video of Walking at Night</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This is a first person POV video, separated by gender (male and female only at this time), that displays the experience of walking to a friend’s
	place on campus late at night. This design is critical of the gendered differences in thought about walking home at night, although at this time,
	we want to show both parties as being worried to emphasize that personal safety regardless of gender should not be on the student alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Our intended audience is Passive Allies (parents, faculty, staff, apathetic students), and we want to use this critical design intervention to shift
	them into Active Allies (students, especially those who live on campus). In turn, formerly Passive Allies will be in a better position to sway Passive
	Opposition (donors, people involved with the Chancellor) if the intervention gains traction.

	<h3> Testing </h3>
	<center><img src="images/critDesTest.png"  id = "pfp3"></center>
	<center><p><small>Testing with our classmates</small></p></center>
	<p>
	Through testing, we got to see many of the things that worked in our concepts as well as some of the things that didn't work. It was a a humbling but insightful time for us
	as we saw the flaws in our designs start to come up, but it was super helpful because we were able to knock out the concepts and features that didn't work and move forward.

	<h3> Final Intervention </h3>
	<center><img src="images/critDesFinal.png"  id = "pfp3"></center>
	<center><p><small>Launch day!</small></p></center>
	<p>
	<b>Step 1. Talking about Campus Safety.</b> The first step of our project was pretty straight-forward; talk to students on campus and ask them if they wanted to UCSD a safer place. On week 10, our team went out on UCSD's Library Walk 
	to set up our posters and talk to students about how the current state of night safety is on campus and how we can make it better. Along with us chatting to students, we had an interactive poster that said "I Can Help UCSD's
	Campus be a Safer Place by...". We provided three pre-written responses that students could choose 
	from or they had the option to write their own.

	<center><img src="images/critOptions.png"  width= " 70%"></center>
	<center><p><small>our 4 options to choose from</small></p></center>
	<p>
	<b> Step 2. Creating a Visual.</b> The list of options that pledgers could choose from serves two purposes; one, to remind pledgers the basic things we can do to serve each other; and two, to act as a visual aid for
	passer-bys to see that there is a growing community of people who are willing to help each other. 
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/critProject.png"   id = "pfp3"></center>
	<center><p><small>participants would tack their chosen option on the board to create a visual for others.</small></p></center>
	
	
	<center><img src="images/critLast.jpg"   id = "pfp3"></center>
	<center><p><small>wearing the glowing bracelets would literally make students be a <i>"Light On Their Campus"</i>!</small></p></center>
	<p>
	<b>Step 3. Creating a Community</b>
	<p> The last step of our final intervention was to create a community of people who would look after one another. For our project we gave out glow sticks bracelets to participants who took the pledge
	in hopes that they would wear them later that night. Our vision was that students walking at night would feel safer if they saw the glowing lights at night because the bracelets represent a community of people who took a 
	pledge to do something.
