		<h1>Hello,</h1><p> I'm </p><p style = "color: #336E7B;">Alex Kim</p> <p> and I am a UX/Product designer.
		I believe that design is my calling; not because I am particularly good at 
		design but because I believe design is ultimately about making good choices
		and that is an aspiration worth pursuing. 
		

	
	Although my main interest is in design, I also have a fascination  with the production
	side of a team and getting to know the challenges they face.

	<center><h1> Traits That Help Me as a Designer </h1></center>
	
	</br>
	
	<img src="images/curiosity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>1.Curiosity</h3>
	<p>
	Growing up I was always that annoying kid who asked "why?" all the time; which I still am to this day (kind of).
	Curiosity not only helped me observe and learn from my surroundings, it has greatly helped me when making decisions.
	Asking "why?" is a very important step before implementing because I want to make sure my design choices lead my team
	to a direction we want to be headed in.
	</p>
	<img src="images/humulity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>2.Humility</h3>
	<p>
	Humility not only presses us to improve it is essential for giving and receiving criticism.
	Although I do have a passion for my work, I believe it is important to
	separate my identity from my work. Whether it be a good product or bad, it is hard to receive 
	constructive criticism when I am too attached to my work or prideful. I actively practice humility by asking my design peers
	to constantly critique my work and do the best I can to give them good critique in return. 
	</p>
	<img src="images/communication.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>3.Communication</h3>
	<p>
	One of the biggest take-aways I got from working in teams is that communication is the most important thing.
	I have come to realize that as an individual I am limited in what I can achieve by myself and in order to make make great products 
	it requires a lot of people with a lot of specializations engaging and understanding each other. In my opinion, the best way to practice
	communication is simply social interaction. Whether its at my on-campus job, at church, or in class discussion I make an effort to 
	be genuinely engaged in my conversations so I can communicate and listen effectively. 

	</p>
	<img src="images/empathy.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>4.Empathy</h3>
	<p>
	I believe that being a good designer is much like being a great host; a designer needs to think about and care for their customers and team-mates.
	Serving and caring for others are traits that, as a Christian, I hope to reflect. 
	</p>
	<img src="images/integrity.png" id = "pfp4">
	<h3>5.Integrity</h3>
	<p>
	I was always taught to be man of my word. From small things like being on time, to bigger things like following through on favours
	I make sure to keep my word. As a designer, I know that it is inevitable that I will be giving somebody an order at some point. With that in mind,
	it’s within my best interest to be man of my word in all aspects in life,
	because how can I expect somebody to take my orders when I don’t take my own words seriously.
