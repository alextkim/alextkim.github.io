	<h3>Why we started this project</h3>
	<p>
	Over the summer a group of my friends and I decided to design and create a mobile app with mini-games to pass time and be productive.
	My part in the team was primarily with 
	the graphic arts. Even though we never did end up finishing the site it was a good learning experience and a humbling one. From this
	project I got to see how important product design was.
	</p>
	
	<h3> The Need </h3>
	<p>
	My friends and I reminisced about the days we used to play Neopets (a web-based game site) 
	and we realized that Neopet's multi game function paired with a system of pets
	could potentially be a good idea to make on a mobile platform.
	</p>
	<h3> Target Audience </h3>
	<p>
	Our target audience for this app were kids and adults who enjoy phone games. Unfortunately we did not get to 
	interview any body for this project to get user research.

	<h3> The Result </h3>
	<p>
	Ultimately, we did not finish this project. Even though this project was a failure I learned a lot.
	We jumped into production way too quickly without even thinking about design. We were all too focused
	on making a tangible game that we did not even organize our roles, the team's core values, and project management. Personally, I was too focused on
	the UI and graphics and did not stop to think about the
	other components of design like, user research, user testing, and flow of the game. This negelect ultimately lead to no structure for the production team. 
	The biggest take away I got from this was that I have responsibility to 
	not only manage the product but to make sure everyone is on board and held accountable.
