	<h3>Why we started this project</h3>
	<p>
	To put it simply, this project was an assignment given to me and my teammates in one of the design-based
	classes that UCSD offers. For this class students were formed teams of 5-7, coordinated team meetings, and fleshed out a digital application 
	designed to meet a problem space of their choice.  This was one of the
	first group-based projects I contributed to so I learned a lot about being
	part of design-team.

	<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
	<p>
	This class was a challenge because as soon as we got in to our design teams our we  were on our own. This was both a liberating and
	daunting feeling; we had the power to create anything that wanted! But at the same time it had be somewhat applicable in the real world. We didn’t want to
	be designing an app that no one would use. From the get go, it seemed like many of us already
	had a few ideas that we thought would make the a good app. However, we realized that in order to make an useful app we needed to take a step back and 
	start with questions like “who are we designing for?” and “what needs 
	do these people have?”. In the end we decided to tackle the need for more creativity in students and from there we set course to do some user research.

	<h3>The Research</h3>
	<p>
	For me, this was the first time I had conducted user research for a product so it was 
	difficult at times but with the guidance of some of my more experienced team-mates we managed to pull
	some good data. We knew we wanted to design a product with college students being its target audience. 
	This made it easy for us to conduct research on potential consumers since we
	all happen to attend UCSD.

	<h3> What We Found</h3>
	<p>
	Through our research we ended up finding out that this problem is uncommon and that it would be quite difficult to create a product that could effectively aid people from all sorts of backgrounds. Despite knowing it would be difficult we decided to pursue this idea.  Some of the things we found regarding creativity were, but not limited too: 
    <div class = "quickInfo">
	<p>1. People don’t have the time to pursue creativity</p>
    <p>2. Most people felt that they get the most creative when under pressure (not too much though)</p>
	<p>3. People felt that they would be motivated if they had peers.</p>

	<h3> Our Solution </h3>
	<p>
	Idea8 was actually inspired by the ideation process called crazy8s where teams were called to rapidly 
	brainstorm 8 ideas individually and collaborate amongst themselves to come up with a solution together.
	As a design team we also used this technique in our ideation phase and thought it would could be a
	great solution to our creativity crisis. From there we decided to create a digital platform of crazy8s
	so that teams could communicate and collaborate remotely and effectively. When making this product we
	envisioned students who had trouble finding inspiration for their next art project or teams who need
	to collaborate to get to a solution to find this useful.
