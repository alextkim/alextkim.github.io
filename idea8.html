	<h3>What is idea8?</h3>
	<p>
    <mark><i>"A bad idea takes just as much time to implement as a good one."</i></mark> Thatâ€™s why when our team decided to create idea8 we had one thing in mind; to 
	help our consumers find good ideas. Idea8 is a product for groups and individuals that encourages users to branch out and
	think through their options before making costly decisions. Idea8 was designed to foster the creative fuel of people who plan events, problem solve, create 
	works of art, and much more.

	<h3>Need Finding Stage</h3>
	<p>
	Our team decided to tackle the very broad topic of creativity and how it seems to a dying art.
	In a society where mottos like nike's <i>"Just Do It"</i> or the ever popular yolo seems to be part of our everyday culture,
	its no surprise that <mark>people look towards the easiest and fastest solutions</mark> in order to keep pace in this progressive lifestyle. 
	But the quick and easy solutions that people scramble to execute are often times not the best. As designers, we know that these quick 
	seemingly easy and quick fixes are the first to pop in to our minds but when actually jumping into production can lead to a mess. That is 
	why we decided to create a product to <mark> help individuals push their ideas and weigh their options before <i>"just doing it"</i>.</mark> 
	</p>

	<h3>Target Audience</h3>
	<p>
	Although the above image exemplified the pathways for a novice and senior designer, we sought to make a product that can be useful for <mark>anybody
	who needs to tackle a problem.</mark> Whether they are:
	<div class = "list">
		<ol><i>1. An Artist who needs inspiration</i></ol>
		<ol><i>2. An engineering team that needs a creative solution</i></ol>
		<ol><i>3. A writer with writers block</i></ol>
		<ol><i>4. Or a student org that is planning an event</i></ol>
	</div>
	<p> Anyone can can benefit from taking the time to ideate!</p>

	<h3> What We Found</h3>

	<p>1. As students, people seem to be pressed for time.</p>
    <p>2. Most people felt that they get the most creative when under pressure.</p>
	<p>3. People felt that they would be motivated if they had peers with them.</p>

	<h3> Our Solution </h3>
	<p>
	From our user research and observations when implementing idea8 there were a few core values
	we decided to focus on: <i>Our product had to be quick, have some sort of pressure, and allow for easy collaboration 
	between peers</i>. In particular, We focused a lot on emphasizing the power of collaboration since more people = more ideas and included more
	features for those that chose to collaborate and gave the option to collaborate remotely since scheduling could be difficult.

	<h3>Future</h3>
	<p>
	The end product we made is still to be considered a mockup and does not have full functionality and is missing some stuff aesthetically. I think if
	we were push this further we would definitely need a larger team with a more diverse skill set. As a team composed of 7 designers and no coders or artists
	it was a bit difficult getting the production technicalities worked out.
